## Lists of Things

An *array* is a list of things.

```javascript
  var things = ["thing1", "thing2", "thing3"];
```

When you want to select something from an array, you can
find it using the order in the group, or you can use a loop to find it.

In programming, all lists of things are ordered starting with zero!

```javascript
alert(things[0]);

for (var i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
  alert(things[i]);
}
```
