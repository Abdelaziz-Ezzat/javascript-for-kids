## Doing the same thing again and again

If you want to do something a set amount of time, use a *for loop*

```javascript
for (i = 0; i < 3; i++) {

}
```
If you want to keep something running until something changes, use a *while loop*

```javascript
while () {

}
```

Beward of the *infinite loop*

```javascript
while (1 === 1) {
  // this will never stop running
}
```
