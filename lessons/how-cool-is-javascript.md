## JavaScript!

### JavaScript is the language of the web.

You can code on any computer as long as it has a browser. You don't have to install any special programs.

### JavaScript doesn't have to be compiled.

This means that JavaScript is "interpreted" by the browser and can be run right away.

### JavaScript is the most popular programming language.

This means that you can find lots of friends to write code with!

### Cats like JavaScript too.
