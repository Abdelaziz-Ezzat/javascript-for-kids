## JavaScript for Kids

Simple word-guess game for teaching JavaScript to kids (ages 9 and up). This game
includes some basic programming concepts such as storing values in variables, working
with arrays, using conditional statements, and using different types of loops.

This version of the game doesn't include validation or complex logic in order to
keep it simple for kids.

I recommend writing code in [jsfiddle.net](www.jsfiddle.net).
Another good tool is [jsbin.com](www.jsbin.com).

### To run this game:

* Clone this repository
* Open `index.html` in a browser

### Or:

* Open the game in [Jsfiddle](http://jsfiddle.net/lynnaloo/Lgeyx450)

### Foundation Lessons

* [JavaScript is Cool](lessons/how-cool-is-javascript.md)
* [Print things and Save them to Variables](outputs-and-variables.md)
* [True, False, and Conditionals](true-false-and-conditional.md)
* [Doing things in a Loop](doing-things-in-a-loop.md)

### Bugs!

This game has bugs! The "homework" from this class is to add functionality and to fix
the existing bugs. Some examples of bug fixes are:

* setting all words to lowercase
* checking for null prompt answers (and other validation)
* allowing a user to quit the game once it has started
* checking for "real" words
